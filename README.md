Walmart project dataset is analysed using excel functions 

🚀 Just wrapped up an exciting analysis for a Walmart project, where I got to dive deep into a fascinating dataset with details like User_ID, Product_ID, Gender, Age, Occupation, City_Category, Stay_In_Current_City_Years, Marital_Status, Product_Category, and Purchase. 🛍️

I used some powerful Excel database functions to draw insights. For instance, I applied the DAVERAGE function to calculate the average purchase specifically for City Category A, which helped uncover purchasing trends in this region. 📊

Next, I utilized the DMAX and DMIN functions to extract the maximum and minimum purchase values from different product categories. This provided a clear picture of which categories are thriving and which need attention. 📉📈

For another part of the analysis, the DSUM function came in handy when I needed to find the total purchase made by customers in the age group 0-17. Understanding the purchasing habits of the youngest shoppers was crucial for future strategic planning! 👶

Additionally, I implemented a conditional logic formula to analyze how marital status impacts purchasing behavior. The formula was straightforward: If marital status is 0, the purchase amount is classified as "less," otherwise it's "more." This insight shed light on how different demographic factors can affect consumer behavior. 💡

Working on this project has deepened my understanding of data analysis and how even the smallest details can reveal significant trends. Excited to continue applying these skills in real-world projects and driving data-driven decisions! 🔍 #DataAnalysis #Excel #Walmart #CustomerInsights #DataDriven #TechSkills #ExcelFunctions #BusinessIntelligence #DatabaseFunctions
